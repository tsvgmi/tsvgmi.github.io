  [D]Sunday morning up with the lark 
  I think I’ll take a walk in the park 
  [G]Hey, hey [A]hey, it’s a beautiful [D]day 
  [D]I’ve got someone waiting for me 
  And when I see her I know that she’ll say 
  [G]Hey, hey [A]hey, it’s a beautiful [D]day 
   
  DK: 
  [D]Hi, hi, hi, beautiful Sun [G]day 
  This is [A]my, my, my beautiful [D]day 
  When you said, said, said 
  Said that you [E7]love me 
  Oh, [G]my, my, [A]my its a beautiful [D]day. 
   
  [D]Birds are singing, you’re by my side 
  Let’s take a car and go for a ride 
  [G]Hey, hey, [A]hey, it’s a beautiful [D]day. 
  [D]We’ll drive on and follow the sun 
  Makin’Sunday go on and on 
  [G]Hey, hey, [A]hey its a beautiful [D]day 
   
  (Lên 1 tone) 
  [E]Hi, hi, hi, beautiful Sun [A]day 
  This is [B]my, my, my beautiful [E]day 
  When you said, said, said 
  Said that you [F#7]love me 
  Oh, [A]my, my, [B]my its a beautiful [E]day.
