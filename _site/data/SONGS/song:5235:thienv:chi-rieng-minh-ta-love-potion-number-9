  [Am]I took my troubles down to [Dm]Madame Ruth 
  [Am]You know that gypsy with the [Dm]gold capped tooth 
  [C]She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and [Am]Vine 
  [Dm]Sellin' little bottles of [E7]Love Potion Number [Am]Nine 
   
  [Am]I told her that I was a [Dm]flop withchicks 
  [Am]I'd been this way since nine- [Dm]teen fifty six 
  [C]She looked at my palm and she made a magic [Am]sign 
  [C]She said "What you need is [E7]Love Potion Number [Am]Nine" 
   
  She [Dm]bent down and turned around and gave me a wink 
  She [B7]said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink" 
  It [Dm]smelled like turpentine, it looked like India Ink 
  I [E7]held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink 
   
  [Am]I didn't know if it was [Dm]day or night 
  [Am]I started kissin' every-[Dm]thing in sight 
  [C]But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and [Am]Vine 
  [Dm]Sellin' little bottles of [E7]Love Potion Number [Am]Nine 
   
  [E7]I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a [E7]drink 
   
  [Am]I didn't know if it was [Dm]day or night 
  [Am]I started kissin' every-[Dm]thing in sight 
  [C]But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and [Am]Vine 
  [Dm]He broke my little bottles of [E7]Love Potion Number [Am]Nine 
  [Dm]Love Potion Number [Am]Nine, love [Dm]otion Number [Am]Nine ...
