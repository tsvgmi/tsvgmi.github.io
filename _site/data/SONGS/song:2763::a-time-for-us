  [Am]A time for [Em]us someday there'll [F]be 
  When chains are [Em]torn 
  By courage [Dm]born of a love that's [Am]free 
  A time when [Em]dreams so long de- [F]nied 
  Can [Dm]flou- [Em]rish as [Am]we unveil the love 
  We now [Em]must [Am]hide 
   
  Chorus: A [C]time for [G]us at [Dm]last to [Am]see 
  A [Bb]life worth- [F]while for [Em]you and [Am]me 
   
  And with our [Em]love through tears and [F]thorns 
  We will end- [Em]ure 
  As we pass [Dm]surely through every [Am]storm 
  A time for [Em]us someday there'll [F]be 
  A [Dm]new [Em]world 
  A [Am]world of shining hope for you [Em]and [Am]me
