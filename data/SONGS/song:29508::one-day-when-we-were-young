  [D]One [Fdim]day when [Em]we were [A]young
  One [D]wonderful [Fdim]morning in [D]May
  You [Gmaj7]told [Gm6]me : " You [D]love [B7]me "
  When [Em]we were [A]young one [D]day
   
  [D]Sweet [Fdim]songs of [Em]Spring were [A]sung
  And [D]music was [Fdim]never so [D]gay
  You [Gmaj7]told [Gm6]me : " You [D]love [B7]me "
  When [Em]we were [A]young one [D]day
   
  You [F#7]told [Bm]me: " You [F#7]love [Bm]me "
  And [E7]help me close to your [A]heart
  You [F#7]laughed [Bm]then, You [F#7]cried [Bm]then,
  And [E7]came the time to [A]part
   
  [D]When [Fdim]songs of [Em]Spring are [A]sung
  Re[D]member [Fdim]that morning in [D]May
  [Gmaj7]Remem[Gm6]ber: " You [D]loved [B7]me " ?
  When [Em]we were [A]young one [D]day .
