  1. Each day I [G]live I want to be
  A day to [D]give the best of me
  I'm only [G]one but not [C]alone
  My finest [D]day is yet unknown
   
  I broke my [G]heart for every gain
  To taste the [D]sweet I faced the pain
  I rise and [G]fall yet through it [C]all
  This must [D]remains
   
  Chorus: I want [G]one [D]moment in [Em]time
  When I'm [Am]more than I thought I could [D]be
  When [C]all of my [D]dreams are a [G]heart beat [Em]away
  And the [Am]answers are all up to [D]me
   
  Give me [G]one [D]moment in [Em]time
  When I'm [Am]racing with desti- [D]ny
  [C]Then [D]in that one [G]moment of [Em]time
  I will [Am]feel, I will [D]feel eterni- [G]ty [Em] [D]uhm
   
  2. I've lived to [G]be the very best
  I want it [D]all, no time for less
  I've laid the [G]plans, now lay the [C]chance
  Here in my [D]hands
   
  Chourus: Give me [G]one [D]moment in [Em]time
  When I'm [Am]more than I thought I could [D]be
  When [C]all of my [D]dreams are a [G]heart beat [Em]away
  And the [Am]answers are all up to [D]me
   
  Give me [G]one [D]moment in [Em]time
  When I'm [Am]racing with desti- [D]ny
  [C]Then [D]in that [G]one [D]moment of [Em]time
  I will [Am]feel, I will [D]feel eterni- [G]ty
