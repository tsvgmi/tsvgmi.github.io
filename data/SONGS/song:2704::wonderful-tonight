  [G] [D] [C] [D] 
  [G]It's late in the [D]evening; 
  [C]She's wondering what clothes [D]to wear. 
  [G]She puts on her [D]make-up 
  [C]And brushes her long [A]blonde hair. 
  [C]And then she asks [D]me, [G]"Do I [D]look all [Em]right?" 
  And I say, [C]"Yes, you look [D]wonderful tonight." [G] [D] [C] [D] 
  [G]We go to a [D]party 
  [C]And everyone turns [D]to see 
  [G]This beautiful [D]lady 
  [C]That's walking around [A]with me. 
  [C]And then she asks [D]me, [G]"Do you [D]feel all [Em]right?" 
  And I say, [C]"Yes, I feel [D]wonderful tonight." [G] [D] [C] [D] 
  I feel [C]wonderful be [D]cause I see 
  The [G]love light [D]in your [Em]eyes. 
  And the [C]wonder of it [D]all 
  Is that you [C]just don't [D]realize how much I [G]love you. [D] 
  [G]It's time to go [D]home now 
  [C]And I've got an [D]aching head, 
  [G]So I give her the [D]car keys 
  And [C]she helps me to bed. [D] 
  [C]And then I tell [D]her, 
  [G]As I [D]turn out the [Em]light, 
  I say, "My [C]darling, you are [D]wonderful [G]tonight. 
  Oh my [C]darling, you are [D]wonderful [G]tonight." 
  [G] [D] [C]
