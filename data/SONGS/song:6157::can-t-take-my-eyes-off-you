  Verse 1: 
  You're just too [D]good to be true. 
  Can't take my [Dmaj7]eyes off you. 
  You'd be like [D7]heaven to touch. 
  I wanna [G]hold you so much. 
  At long last [Gm6]love has arrived. 
  And I thank [D]God I'm alive. 
  You're just too [E7]good to be true. 
  [Em7b5]Can't take my [D]eyes off you. 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Pardon the [D]way that I stare. 
  There's nothing [Dmaj7]else to compare. 
  The sight of [D7]you leaves me weak. 
  There are no [G]words left to speak. 
  But if you [Gm6]feel like I feel. 
  Please let me [D]know that it's real. 
  You're just too [E7]good to be true. 
  [Em7b5]Can't take my [D]eyes off you.
