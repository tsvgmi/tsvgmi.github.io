  [Dm]I heard she [G]sang a good song, [C]I heard she [F]had a style.
  [Dm]And so I [G]came to see her and [Am]listen for a while.
  [Dm]And there she [G]was this young girl, [C]a stranger to [E]my eyes.
   
  [Am]Strumming my pain with her [Dm]fingers,
  [G]singing my life with her [C]words,
  [Am]killing me softly with [D]her song,
  killing me [G]softly with her [F]song,
  telling my [C]whole life with her [F]words,
  killing me [Bb]softly with her [A]song
   
  [Dm]I felt all [G]flushed with fever, [C]embarrassed [F]by the crowd,
  [Dm]I felt she [G]found my letters and [Am]read each one out loud.
  [Dm]I prayed that [G]she would finish [C]but she just [E]kept right on.
   
  [Am]Strumming my pain with her [Dm]fingers,
  [G]singing my life with her [C]words,
  [Am]killing me softly with [D]her song,
  killing me [G]softly with her [F]song,
  telling my [C]whole life with her [F]words,
  killing me [Bb]softly with her [A]song
   
  [Dm]She sang as [G]if she knew me [C]in all my [F]dark despair
  [Dm]and then she [G]looked right through me [Am]as if I wasn't there.
  [Dm]But she just [G]came to singing, [C]singing [E]clear and strong.
   
  [Am]Strumming my pain with her [Dm]fingers,
  [G]singing my life with her [C]words,
  [Am]killing me softly with [D]her song,
  killing me [G]softly with her [F]song,
  telling my [C]whole life with her [F]words,
  killing me [Bb]softly with her [A]song
