  1. [Dm]Since you were an angel [Gm]from the sky, [C]you fill my fanta-[Dm]sy 
  The way you look takes [Gm]me so high, [C]you're everything to [F]me 
  And [Dm]all I want is your [Bb]photograph, how I'm [C]longing for your [F]smile 
  So [Dm]come and touch me, [Gm]come and feel me, [A]hear me cry. 
   
  Chorus:You're my [Dm]love (you're my love) 
  You're my [Gm]life (you're my life) 
  Every [C]day (everyday) Every [F]night (every night) 
  Is it [Dm]right (is it right) What I [Gm]feel (what I feel) 
  How I [A]wish you were for [Dm]real. 
   
  You're my [Dm]love (you're my love) you're my [Gm]life (you're my life) 
  Every [C]day (everyday) every [F]night (every night) 
  In my [Dm]dreams (in my dreams) I'm with [Gm]you (I'm with you) 
  Will you [A]make my dreams come [Dm]true? 
   
  2. [Dm]I'm all alone the [Gm]night has come, [C]you're in my radi-[Dm]o 
  It's when you sing I [Gm]feel the sun, [C]now i can feel the [F]show 
  Since for-[Dm]evermore you're my [Bb]destiny, take my [C]loneliness a-[F]way 
  So [Dm]come and touch me, [Gm]come and feel me, [A]hear me [Dm]say 
   
  * Since for-[Dm]evermore you're my [Bb]destiny, take my [C]loneliness a-[F]way 
  So [Dm]come and touch me, [Gm]come and feel me, [A]hear me [Dm]say
