  [Dm]Lady - I'm your [Gm]knight in shining  [C]armor - and I [Dm]love you 
  You have [Gm]made me what I [C]am and --- I am [Dm]yours 
  My love - there's [Gm]so many ways I [C]want to say - I [Dm]love you 
  Let me [Gm]hold you in my [C]arms for --- ever [Dm]more 
   
  You have [Gm]gone - and [Am]made me such a fool [Bb]- I'm so [Am]lost - in your [D]love 
  And [Gm]oh - we belong[Am]together [Bb]- Won't you [Am]believe - in my [Dsus4]song [D] 
   
  [Dm]Lady - for so [Gm]many years I [C]thought - I'd never  [Dm]find you 
  You have [Gm]come into my [C]life and - made me [Dm]whole 
  [Dm]Forever - let me [Gm]wake to see you [C]each and every [Dm]morning 
  Let me [Gm]hear you whisper [C]softly --- in my [Dm]ear 
   
  In my [Gm]eyes - I see [Am]no one else but you [Bb]- There's no [Am]other - love like our [D]love 
  And [Gm]yes - oh yes I'll [Am]always want you near me [Bb]- I've waited for [Am]you for so [D]long 
   
  [Bb]Lady - [Am7]your love's - the [F]only love I [F/E]need [Dm] [Dm/C] 
  And [Bb]beside me - [Am7]is where - I [F]want you to [F/E]be [Dm] [Dm/C] 
  'Cause [Bb]my love - [Am7]there's somethin' I [F]want you - to [F/E]know [Dm] [Dm/C] 
  You're the [Bb]love of [Am7]my [Gm]life - [C]you're my [Dm]lady . [Gm] [C] [Dm]
