  When I was [G]just a little girl,
  I asked my [Am]mother, what will I be?
  Will I be [D]pretty, will I be rich?
  [D7]Here's what [G]she said to [G7]me.
  CHORUS:
  Que [G7]Sera, Sera, [C]whatever will be, will [G]be.
  The [D]future's not [D7]ours, to see. [G]Que Sera, Ser..a. [D]
  What will [D7]be, will [G]be.
  When I was just a child in school,
  I asked my teacher, what should I try?
  Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs?
  This was her re..ply...
  CHORUS:
  When I grew up and fell in love,
  I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead?
  Will we have rainbows, day after day?
  Here's what my sweetheart said.
  CHORUS:
  Now I have children of my own,
  They ask their mother, what will I be?
  Will I be handsome? will I be rich?
  I tell them tender..ly.
