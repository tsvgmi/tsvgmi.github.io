  [G]Silent night, holy night
  [D7]All is [C]calm, all [G]is bright
  [C]Round yon Virgin [G]Mother and Child
  [C]Holy Infant so [G]tender and [Em]mild
  [D]Sleep in heavenly [C]peace [G]
  Sleep in [D7]heavenly [G]peace
  [G]Silent night, holy night!
  [D7]Shepherds [C]quake at [G]the sight
  [C]Heavenly hosts from [G]heaven above
  [C]Guardian Angels [G]sing [Em]Alleluia!
  [D]Christ, our Saviour is [C]born [G]
  Christ, our [D7]Saviour [G]is born
