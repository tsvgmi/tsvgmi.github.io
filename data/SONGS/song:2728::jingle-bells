:lyric: |-
  [D]Dashing through the snow, in a one horse open [G]sleigh
  [Em]O're the fields [A7]we go, laughing all [D]the way
  [D]Bells on bobtail ring, Making spirits [G]bright,
  what [Em]fun it is [A7]to ride and sing a sleighing [D]song tonight.
  [D]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
  [G]Oh, what fun it [D]is to ride on a [E7]one-horse [A]open sleigh.
  Oh, [D]jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
  [G]Oh, what fun it [D]is to ride in a [E7]one horse [A]open sleigh.
  [D]A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a [G]ride
  And [Em]soon Miss [A7]Fannie Bright, was seated by [D]my side,
  The [D]horse was lean and lank, Misfortune seemed his [G]lot,
  [Em]He got into [A7]a drifted bank, and we, we [D]got up-sot.
  Chorus
  [D]Now the ground is white, go it while you're [G]young
  [Em]Take the [A7]girls tonight, and sing this [D]sleighing song,
  [D]Just get a bobtail nag, two forty for his [G]speed,
  Then [Em]hitch him to [A7]an open sleigh, and crack, you'll take [D]the lead.
  Chorus
