  [Am]I fell in love with you watching Casa [Dm]blanca 
  [G]Back row of the drive in show in the [C]flickering light 
  [E7]Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars [Am]became champagne and [Dm]caviar 
  [G]Making love on a [G]long hot summers [Am]night. 
   
  [Am]I thought you fell in love with me watching Casa [Dm]blance 
  [G]Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's [C]Candle lit cafe 
  [E7]Hiding in the shadows from the spies. [Am]Moroccan moonlight [Dm]in your eyes 
  Making [G]magic at the movies in [G]my old chevro [Am]let. 
   
  Chorus 
  Oh! A [Dm]kiss is still a [G]kiss in Casa [C]blanca......[A7] 
  But a [Dm]kiss is not a [G]kiss without your [C]sigh 
  [Am]Please come back to me in Casa [Dm]blanca 
  [G]I love you more and more each day as time goes [Am]by. 
   
  [Am]I guess there're many broken hearts in Casa [Dm]blanca 
  [G]You know I've never really been there. so, I don't [C]know 
  [E7]I guess our love story will never be seen [Am]on the big wide [Dm]silver screen 
  But it [G]hurt just as bad when I [Em]had to watch you go. [Am] 
   
  Chorus 
  Oh! A [Dm]kiss is still a [G]kiss in Casa [C]blanca [A7] 
  But a [Dm]kiss is not a [G]kiss without your [C]sigh 
  [Am]Please come back to me in Casa [Dm]blanca 
  [G]I love you more and more each [Em]day as time goes [Am]by. 
   
  Chorus 
  Oh! A [Dm]kiss is still a [G]kiss in Casa [C]blanca [A7] 
  But a [Dm]kiss is not a [G]kiss without your [C]sigh 
  [Am]Please come back to me in Casa [Dm]blanca 
  [G]I love you more and more each [Em]day as time goes [Am]by 
  I [Dm]love you more and more each [G]day as time goes [Am]by.
