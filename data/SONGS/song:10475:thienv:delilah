  [Am]I saw the light on the night that I passed by her [E7]window 
  [Am]I saw the flickering shadow of love on her [E7]blind 
  [A7]She was my [Dm]woman 
  [Am]As she deceived me I [E7]watched and went out of my [Am]mind [G] 
   
  [C]My my my [G7]Delilah 
  [G7]Why why why [C]Delilah 
  [C]I could [C7]see, that [F]girl was no good for [Dm]me 
  [C]But I was lost like a [G]slave that no man could [C]free [E7] 
   
  [Am]At break of day when that man drove away I was [E7]waiting 
  [Am]I crossed the street to her house and she opened the [E7]door 
  [A7]She stood there [Dm]laughing 
  [Am]I felt the knife in my [E7]hand and she laughed no [Am]more [G] 
   
  [C]My my my [G7]Delilah 
  [G7]Why why why [C]Delilah 
  [C]So [C7]before they [F]come to break down the [Dm]door 
  [C]Forgive me Delilah I just [G]couldn't take any [C]more [E7] 
   
  [A7]She stood there [Dm]laughing 
  [Am]I felt the knife in my [E7]hand and she laughed no [Am]more [G] 
  [C]My my my [G7]Delilah 
  [G7]Why why why [C]Delilah 
  [C]So [C7]before they [F]come to break down the [Dm]door 
  [C]Forgive me Delilah [G]I just couldn't take any [C]more 
  [Am]Forgive me Delilah [E7]I just couldn't take any [Am]more [D] [Am]
