  [D]Listen to the rhythm of the [G]falling rain 
  [D]Telling me just what a fool I've [A]been

  And [D]let me be [A]alone [D]again [A] 
   
  The [D]only girl I care about has [G]gone away 
  [D]Looking for a brand new [A]start 
  But [D]little does she know 
  That when she [G]left that day 
  [D]Along with her she [A]took my [D]heart
