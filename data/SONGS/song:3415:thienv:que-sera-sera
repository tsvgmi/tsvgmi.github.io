:lyric: |-
  When I was [G]just a little girl
  I asked my mother, what will I [Am]be
  [D]Will I be pretty, will I be rich
  [D7]Here's what she said to [G] [G7]me.
   
  Que [C]Sera, Sera,
  Whatever will [G]be, will be
  The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]
  Que Sera, [G]Sera[D]
  What will [D7]be, will [G]be.
   
  When I grew[G] up and fell in love
  I asked my sweetheart what lies [Am]ahead
  [D]Will we have rainbows, day after day
  [D7]Here's what my sweetheart [G] [G7]said.
   
  Que [C]Sera, Sera,
  Whatever will [G]be, will be
  The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]
  Que Sera, [G]Sera[D]
  What will [D7]be, will [G]be.
   
  Now I have [G]children of my own
  They ask their mother, what will I [Am]be
  [D]Will I be handsome, will I be rich
  [D7]I tell them [G] [G7]tenderly.
   
  Que [C]Sera, Sera,
  Whatever will [G]be, will be
  The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]
  Que Sera, [G]Sera[D]
  What will [D7]be, will [G]be.
