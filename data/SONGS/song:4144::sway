:lyric: |-
   
  When marimba rhythms [Gm]start to play 
  Dance with me, [Dm]make me sway 
  Like a lazy ocean [A7]hugs the shore 
  Hold me close, [Dm]sway me more 
   
  Like a flower bending in [Gm]the breeze 
  Bend with me, [Dm]sway with ease 
  When we dance you have a [A7]way with me 
  Stay with me, [Dm]sway with me 
   
  Other dancers may [C]be on the floor 
  Dear, but my eyes will [F]see only you 
  Only you have that [A7]magic technique 
  When we sway I go [A#]weak [A7] 
   
  I can hear the sounds of [Gm]violins 
  Long before it [Dm]begins 
  Make me thrill as only [A7]you know how 
  Sway me smooth, [Dm]sway me now 
   
  I can hear the sounds of violins 
  Long before it begins 
  Make me thrill as only you know how 
  Sway me smooth, sway me now 
  You know how 
  Sway me smooth, sway me now
