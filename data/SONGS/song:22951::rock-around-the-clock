  [A]One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock 
  [A7]Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, rock 
  [A]Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, rock 
  We're gonna [E7]rock around the clock tonight. 
   
  Put your [A]glad rags on and join me, hon, 
  we'll have some fun when the [A7]clock strikes one 
  We're gonna [D7]rock around the clock tonight, 
  we're gonna rock, [A]rock, rock, 'til broad daylight. 
  We're gonna [E7]rock, gonna rock, a[D7]round the clock to[A]night. 
   
  When the [A]clock strikes two, three and four, 
  if the band slows down we'll [A7]yell for more 
  We're gonna [D7]rock around the clock tonight, 
  we're gonna rock, [A]rock, rock, 'til broad daylight. 
  We're gonna [E7]rock, gonna rock, a[D7]round the clock to[A]night. 
   
  (solo) 
   
  When the [A]chimes ring five, six and seven, 
  we'll be right in [A7]seventh heaven. 
  We're gonna [D7]rock around the clock tonight, 
  we're gonna rock, [A]rock, rock, 'til broad daylight. 
  We're gonna [E7]rock, gonna rock, a[D7]round the clock to[A]night. 
   
  When it's [A]eight, nine, ten, eleven too, 
  I'll be goin' strong and [A7]so will you. 
  We're gonna [D7]rock around the clock tonight, 
  we're gonna rock, [A]rock, rock, 'til broad daylight. 
  We're gonna [E7]rock, gonna rock, a[D7]round the clock to[A]night. 
   
  solo 
   
  When the [A]clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then, 
  start a rockin' round the [A7]clock again. 
  We're gonna [D7]rock around the clock tonight, 
  we're gonna rock, [A]rock, rock, 'til broad daylight. 
  We're gonna [E7]rock, gonna rock, a[D7]round the clock to[A]night.
